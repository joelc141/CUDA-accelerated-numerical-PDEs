# CUDA-accelerated-numerical-PDEs
CUDA project(still working on it)
Working on using PDEs to accelerate processing of PDEs. Some PDEs have many dimensions or variables and can become incredibly expensive to calculate. As such, some of them
can be written in a different form as a sparse matrix, allowing for CUDA calculations.

The other code is just a simple PDE in cuda, this isnt very practical but serves as a start.
